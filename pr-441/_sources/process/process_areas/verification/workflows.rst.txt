   ``[TODO: Add additional inputs.]``

   The verification plan is created and maintained by :need:`rl__committer`. It will clearly
   outline all aspects of the verification activities, provide a roadmap for the verification
   efforts throughout the software development lifecycle. The plan should be dynamic and updated
   as needed throughout the project lifecycle.
