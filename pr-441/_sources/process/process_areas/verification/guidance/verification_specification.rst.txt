Verification Specification Guideline
====================================

``[TODO: Check if this is really seen as own document. As per review comment we may not want it at all]``

.. gd_guidl:: Verification Specification Guideline
   :id: gd_guidl__verification_specification
   :status: valid
   :complies: std_wp__iso26262__support_12

Test description
----------------

Following Given-When-Then is a preferred way to write test specifications.

* | Given (alternatively // Setup  )
  | This section contains the setup of the input.
* | Expected
  | This Section contains the expectation for calls to mocks or stubs
* | When (alternatively  // Call   )
  | This section contains the call to the software under test.
* | Then (alternatively // Expect )
  | This section contains the verification criteria of the test (e.g. all EXPECT statements).

.. code-block:: cpp

   TEST(CreateObjectHistory, GivenVehicleInFront_ExpectHistoryBehindFrontVehicle)
   {
      // Given
      const auto whatever_input_values = CreateVehicleInFront();

      // Expected
      EXPECT_CALL(..., ...);

      // When
      const auto history = CreateObjectHistory(whatever_input_values, ...);

      // Then
      for (const auto point : history)
      {
         EXPECT_EQ(..., ...);
      }
   }

Another example for a good test description could be:

  | Verify successful login with valid credentials.
  | Input:
  | - Username: testuser
  | - Password: password123
  | Expected Outcome:
  | - User is redirected to the home page and the welcome message "Hello, testuser!" is displayed.

A example for a bad test description could be:

   Test user login

Additional information can also be found in :doc:`./verification_guidance`.

The specification is part of the test implementatin and has to comply to the requirements
specified in :need:`gd_req__link_tests`.
