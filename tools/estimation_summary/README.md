# Two approaches

## v1 - Using the `manual` queries

It's not quite in a working state, but this is simply due to careless moving of files
and functions. You can still see all the code.

Basically it has the queries and manual code to parse those queries. It's a lot of
boilerplate.

## v2 - Using 'ariande' code generation

This is the approach I'm currently working on. The goal is to reduce manually written
code to a minimum.

We'll see whether it's actually better or not.
