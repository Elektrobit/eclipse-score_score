# v2
See [comparison](../README.md) for a comparison between v1 and v2.

## schema.docs.graphql

Let's assume schema.docs.graphql is downloaded from the server.
We already have the required code in v1.

## generated code

Let's assume the ariande directory will be generated by bazel, and will not have to be
checked in, in the future.

## run generator

It's currently NOT integrated into `docs:ide_support`, or as a separate target.

Install via `pip install ariadne-codegen`.

Run: `cd tools/estimation_summary/v2/ && python -m ariadne_codegen --config ariande_v2.toml`

Because I don't want to have that in the main config?!
