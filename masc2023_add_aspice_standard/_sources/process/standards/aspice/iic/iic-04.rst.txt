.. req:: 04-04 Software Architecture
   :id: R_ASPICE-40_IIC-04-04
   :status: draft

   Software Architecture may have the following characteristics:

   - A justifying rationale for the chosen architecture.
   - Individual functional and non-functional behavior of the software
     component
   - Settings for application parameters (being a technical implementation
     solution for configurability-oriented requirements)
   - Technical characteristics of interfaces for relationships between software components such as:

     - Synchronization of Processes and tasks
     - Programming language call
     - APIs
     - Specifications of SW libraries
     - Method definitions in an object- oriented class definitions or
       UML/SysML interface classes
     - Callback functions, “hooks”

   - Dynamics of software components and software states such as:

     - Logical software operating modes (e.g, start-up, shutdown, normal
       mode, calibration, diagnosis, etc.)
     - intercommunication (processes, tasks, threads) and priority
     - time slices and cycle time
     - interrupts with their priorities
     - interactions between software components

   - Explanatory annotations, e.g, with natural language, for single elements
     or entire diagrams/models.

.. req:: 04-05 Software detailed design
   :id: R_ASPICE-40_IIC-04-05
   :status: draft

   Software detailed design may have the following characteristics:

   - Elements of a software detailed design:

     - Control flow definition
     - Format of input/output data
     - Algorithms
     - Defined data structures
     - Justified global variables
     - Explanatory annotations, e.g, with natural language, for single
       elements or entire diagrams/models

   - Examples for expression languages, depending on the complexity or criticality of a software unit:

     - natural language or informal languages
     - semi-formal languages (e.g, UML, SysML)
     - formal languages (e.g, model-based approach)
