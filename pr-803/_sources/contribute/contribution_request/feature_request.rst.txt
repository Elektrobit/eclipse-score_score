Feature Request Guideline
##############################

.. document:: Feature Request Guideline
  :id: doc__feature_request_guideline
  :status: valid

This Feature Request Guideline is a "How-To for Dummies" for proposing/contributing a new feature or changes to an existing feature.
This Guideline is based on or references following documents:

* :ref:`Contribution Guideline <contribute_contribution_guideline>`
* :ref:`Change Management Plan <change_mgmt_plan>`
* :ref:`Feature Template <chm_feature_templates>`

Creation of Feature Request
================================
* As the very first step, you will need to become of an official contributor, as described in
  `Actions to Ensure Proper Contribution  <https://eclipse-score.github.io/score/main/contribute/general/contribution_attribution.html#contribution-attribution>`_

* Afterwards you will be able to create a GitHub Issue and mark it

  * with label *feature_request* if you want to propose a new feature, or
  * with label *feature_modification* if you want to propose changes to an existing feature,

  as described in the :ref:`Change Management Plan <change_mgmt_plan>`.

  Please put a short description of your *feature request* into the GitHub Issue description, so that
  everyone can immediately understand, what the *feature request* is about.

  Technical Leads review regulary all new incoming *feature requests* (GitHub Issues labeled as *feature_request* or *feature_modification*).
  This happens normally on Monday in the `Technical Lead cirle <https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-score/discussions/104>`_.
  As soon as you've labeled your GitHub Issue with *feature request*/*feature_modification* label,
  TLs will see the *feature request* and will add it to the special GitHub project,
  `Feature Request GitHub Project <https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-score/projects/4>`_.
  Inside of this *Feature Request GitHub Project* additional states are used for a better tracking of the *feature requests*.
  These states symbolize the status of the *feature request* and not the "GitHub" states of the issue, therefore we will further speak about
  *feauture request status*. The initial status of every *feature request* is set to "Draft".

* After you have created a GitHub Issue, next step would be to start working on the *feature request*.
  First of all, change the status of *Feature Request* to "in Progress" state.
  *Feature Requests*, that stay in the status "Draft" for a longer period of time, will be deleted.
  Afterwards create a PR in the `score repository <https://github.com/eclipse-score/score/tree/main/docs/features>`_ with your proposal.
  The PR should follow the :ref:`Feature Template <chm_feature_templates>`.
  You should try to put as much information as possible, as a good exhaustive description is a prerequisite for *feature request* to be accepted.

It is important to understand, that *feature request* consists of an GitHub Issue, that is used to track organizational information and
PR, that contains the technical content. GitHub Issue always stays assigned to the owner of the *feature request*.
*Feature Request* PR will be always assigned to the owner of the *feature request* as well, but will additionally get the list of reviewers, that
should review this *feature request* PR.


Review of Feature Request
================================
* As soon as you're done with description of your *feature request*, please put the status into "Ready for Review" so that Technical Leads know,
  that they can start with the process of reviewing the *feature request*. Technical Leads will first do a short review of your *feature request*:

  * In case the impact of your *feature request* is trivial, then TLs can process your *feature request* immediately.
  * Normally, TL circle will put the lead of the appropriate *CFT* or *Community* as reviewer to the corresponding PR of the *feature request* for better analysis.
    The CTF/Community lead will change the status of the *feature request* issue to "in Review" as soon as they will start reviewing your *feature request*.
    The review can be delegated to any other participants of the CFT or Community.

      * In case *feature request* can not be clearely assigned to any already existing team, Technical Lead circle will pick at least two suitable candidates
        from the project to review the *feature request* PR. In that case, *feature request* should be reviewed by all reviewers.

  * In case of big architectural impact, Technical Lead cirlce can additionally decide to request a review for *feature request* PR from software architecture community.

* The outcome of the review could be like following:

  * **Accepted** - You *feature request* is accepted. The *feature request* GitHub Issue should contain now a link to a new GitHub issue of type 'Epic',
    that was created by Technical Leads, where detailed information regarding your feature  is documented.
    The epic should be also already assigned to the corresponding team (CFT/Community).
    If none of the CFTs/Communities match the new *feature request*, then a new CFT/Community will be founded.
    You will be invited to the CFT/Community for break down of the *feature request* and planning.
    Your can now merge the *feature request* PR and close the *feature request* Issue.
  * **Rejected** - You *feature request* was rejected. It could be either because you description was
    not mature enough or because the proposal technically doesn't fit into S-CORE roadmap or architecture.
    You will be able to find the summary of the review in the corresponding *feature request* issue comments.
    The review comments will be done directly in the *feature request* PR.
  * **Changes Requested** - We like your idea, but we would like to request some modifications.
    This could be rather technical topics or also syntax issues in the description.
    You will be able to find the summary of the review in the corresponding *feature request* issue comments.
    The review comments will be done directly in the *feature request* PR.
  * **POC needed** - We generally like your idea but we don't have enough technical understanding of the *feature request*,
    e.g. technical scope is too big, and we need a POC to be able to understand better,
    how the proposed *feature request* fits into the overall solution. You will find in the GitHub issue comments the information what your POC should focus on.
    Also a so called *incubation repository* will be created by the reviewers of the *feature request*, where you should implement your POC.
    Please be aware, that POC is not a guarantee, that you *feature request* will be accepted.
