Platform Verification Report
============================

This verification report is based on the :need:`doc__verification_plan`.
It covers all the selected features of the SW platform.

Verification Report contains:

**1. Verification Coverage**

**1.1. on Requirements**
       - Lists of feature requirements tested by which test case, passed/failed and completeness verdict
         (this shall be generated by tools and accompanied by progress charts to be usable also for project steering)
       - For external component Assumptions of Use: coverage by platform safety manual or feature
       - This is split in a list of QM requirements tested and a separate list of tests for ASIL rated requirements.
       - List of feature requirements (ASIL rated) linked to inspection checklist and verdict (derived from PR export)

**1.2. on Architecture**
       - List of feature architecture tags tested by which test case, passed/failed and completeness verdict
         (this shall be generated by tools and accompanied by progress charts to be usable also for project steering)
       - This is split in a list of QM features tested and a separate list of tests for ASIL rated features.
       - List of feature architecture tags (ASIL rated) linked to inspection checklist and verdict (derived from PR export)

       - The lists may also contain other verification methods like "Analysis" - process tbd

**2. DFA Report**
       - List of the performed Feature DFA, pass/fail with open mitigations

**3. Safety Analysis Report**
       - List of the performed Feature Safety Analysis, pass/fail with open mitigations

**Note1:** The verification report is valid for the platform version tagged together with the report
