.. gd_temp:: Software Development Plan
   :id: gd_temp__software_development_plan
   :status: valid
   :complies: std_req__iso26262__management_35, std_req__iso26262__management_36, std_req__iso26262__management_37, std_req__iso26262__management_38, std_req__iso26262__management_39

This document implements :need:`wp__sw_development_plan`.

   | **1. Purpose**
   |
   | Process description of SW development including
   | - selection of design and programming language
   | - design guideline
   | - coding guideline (e.g. MISRA, can also include style guide or naming convention)
   | - SW configuration guideline
   | - Method selection (e.g. for Architecture Verification)
   | - development tools
   |
   | Compare also `Github documentation <https://docs.github.com/en>`_
   | Compare also `Eclipse Project Handbook <https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/>`_
   |
   | **2. Objectives and scope**
   |
   | Objective is to define the main SW development policies as defined in the "Purpose" in an ISO 26262 and ASPICE compliant manner.
   | Scope is the complete SW platform.
   |
   | **3. Approach**
   |
   | **Design Language:** :need:`gd_temp__detailed_design` The Detailed Design ???.
   |
   | **SW Configuration Guideline** ?
   |
   | **Method selection for Architecture Verification** <insert Link>
   |
   | **Development Tools**
   |
   |   **GitHub** GitHub is used for hosting, versioning and contribution of the software. Within
   |   pull requests it's possible to contribute. For contribution a seperate process description is
   |   <Link to contribute> available. In the discussion section the informations regarding meeting
   |   minutes and Working Sections were stored. Within issues can bugfixes, improvements, blank issues
   |   set up. It's also possible to report there Security vulnerabilities. GitHub Actions is used
   |   as a support for continuous integration.
   |
   |   **PlantUML** PlantUML is used for dynamic and static diagrams for unit interaction.
   |
   |   **Sphinx** Sphinx is used for software documentation to generate html-sides from reStructuredText.
   |
   |   **Sphinx-Needs** Sphinx-Needs is used for docs-as-code based documentation thats created
   |   and managed by the sphinx documentation generator. With "needs objects, created in rst-files,
   |   requirements, specifications and so on could be generated. Sphinx-Needs is 100% compliant to
   |   Sphinx and reStructuredText.
   |
   |   **Draw.io**  Draw.io is used to create flowcharts and diagrams for dynamic and static diagrams
   |   for unit interaction.
   |
   |   **C++** C++17 is used for the project. Also some non (safety) critical elements of C++20
   |   <tbd> are allowed.
   |
   |   **Rust**
   |
   |   **Coding Guideline C++** <insert Link>
   |
   |   **Coding Guideline Rust** <insert Link>
   |
   |   **Compiler** GCC is usesd as C++ compiler. The compiler must not be certified. It's used as
   |   a development tool to use e.g. compiler warnings. A qualified compiler from QNX shall mentioned
   |   as highly recommended after it's available.
   |
   |   **Clang-tidy**
   |
   |   **Bazel** Bazel is used for building and testing of the software. The set up and usage of
   |   bazel is escribed in the readme of the Score Platform <Link>.
   |
   |   **Googletest** GoogleTest is Googleâ€™s C++ testing and mocking framework. <Link to https://github.com/google/googletest>
