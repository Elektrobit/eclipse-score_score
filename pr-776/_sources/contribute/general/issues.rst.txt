What is a GitHub Issue?
=======================

A *GitHub Issue* is the way to report bugs or propose improvements without knowing the solution and to request features (incl. scope changes).

For creating *GitHub Issue* compare here:  `Creating a GitHub Issue (Github Docs) <https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/creating-an-issue>`_.

Create an *GitHub Issue* to collect feedback, before investing too much effort into a *PR*. *GitHub Issues* may be accompanied by draft *PRs* if code is to be shown.

It can also be used to collect community input and for planning and tracking activities.

The figure below shows options to report something.
